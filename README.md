An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of  sensing its environment and operating without human  involvement.
Project Overview

Title: Development of an Autonomous Vehicle Using IoT
Objective: Design and implement a prototype autonomous vehicle capable of obstacle avoidance, navigation, and remote monitoring using IoT concepts.

Features
Obstacle Avoidance: Using sensors like ultrasonic or LiDAR.
Navigation: GPS and/or line-following systems.
IoT Integration: Real-time vehicle data uploaded to the cloud or controlled via a mobile/web application.
Remote Monitoring: Dashboard showing telemetry data (speed, location, obstacle distance, etc.).
Autonomous Path Planning: Using algorithms like A* or Dijkstra for navigation.
Required Components
Hardware:

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP32)
Sensors:
Ultrasonic Sensors for obstacle detection
GPS Module for navigation
IMU for orientation
Motors and Motor Drivers (e.g., L298N)
Wi-Fi or Cellular Module for IoT (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32)
Power Supply (batteries or a rechargeable power bank)
Chassis and Wheels
Software:

Arduino IDE for programming the microcontroller
Cloud platform for IoT (e.g., ThingsBoard, AWS IoT, or Google Firebase)
Mobile app (optional) for remote control
Python/JavaScript/Node.js for back-end services
